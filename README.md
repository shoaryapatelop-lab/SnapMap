# 📍 SNAP-MAP  
*A hyperlocal, map-based photo sharing app designed for college campuses.*

SNAP-MAP allows students to instantly capture photos and share them on a live campus map. All photos are geo-tagged, stored securely, and shown as clusters/bubbles on a dynamic map. Students can explore events happening around them, view photos contributed by others, and participate in the campus community in real time.
